# packt-lean-mobile-app-development

Sources and information for the book "Lean mobile app development". The book will arrive by the end of the year.

This book seeks to help you build a profitable business around your mobile app using the the Lean startup methodology. Unlike many other books this one is not only for the business oriented members of your organization. Instead, it is a very practical guide, explaining what tools and techniques can be used to develop apps the Lean way. It is important that technical oriented people also become enthusiastic about the Lean startup methodology, which is the reason why this book is primarily aimed at technical co-owners and developers. They need to have the right tools in order to apply the methodology to their daily mobile app development.  We will discuss how you can save time and reduce waste by using a number of techniques and tools.

On the other hand, the book is interesting for non-technical people too. It would be great if they can obtain a better understanding of the underlying technical processes. We need the business guys to find and to clearly define the problems so the technical guys can deliver the right solutions for them.  Everyone needs to collaborate closely together.  If you have a good understanding of each otherâ€™s perspectives, you can achieve much better results.

This book will be be published by <a href="http:/www.packtpub.com">Packt publishing</a> soon.
